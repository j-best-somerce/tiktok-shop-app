  <h1>Welcome to Somerce TikTok Connector</h1>
  <p>This app is built to help Somerce automate our dataflow to be able to understand what is working for our TikTok shop so we can perform better and make more GMV for our clients and ad spend for TikTok</p>
  <p>This is in super early testing phase and a first attempt at this so please let us know if there's anything here that we have got wrong as we're just trying to do things the correct way</p>
